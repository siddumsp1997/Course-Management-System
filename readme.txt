Welcome to IITKGP Course Management Portal !!
(Developed by Siddharrth Priyadharan M___14CS10046)
I did this using Eclipse Luna.
Name of the Main class: mainclass.java 

You can create new courses and manage the existing ones.It is developed in sucha way that courses
whose age exceeds five will be treated inactive and will be removed from the display list.

Follow the instructions properly as per the command.If the system is asking for any input,make sure
that you give the data properly. 
1.For example,suppose you enter a alphabet/string in place of 1 or any other integer, it may even crash the program.
2.In mobile number field, we expect a 10 digit integer.
3. Follow all instructions displayed in faint text in the textfields.
4. You must strictly follow the format needed, when it comes to the "Course starting date".
5. Suppose you terminate your program in the middle(due to unavoidable circumstances),you cant expect 
   the data(you have entered so far) to be properly entered in the file (as the file wouldn't have been
   properly closed due to the unexpected termination).You can edit the data in the text file to avoid such problems.
6. In case, you want the database of the contact list, you can look out for "course database.txt" file in your 
   system.
7.Closing any one window using close (X) button will terminate the entire program.
  So, make sure that use Back/Back to main menu button to go to previous frames, and EXIT in the main menu
  to exit the program.
8.Please make sure that Fees field is entered with an integer only (float values not allowed) and moreover dont use
  commas in between the value.
9.It is designed in such a way that only those courses whose starting date is within 5 year range.
   (For example, Today's date =10-02-2016; If the course date is within 10-02-2011 and 10-02-2021, then only it will be
    treated as active and get displayed.Otherwise, it wont get displayed.)
10.Ignore the warnings in the code. They wont harm your system in any way.
